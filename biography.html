<h2>Major</h2>


<p>My major is Technical Communication with two minors: Visual communication design and Africana studies</p>
<br>


<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I grew up in Maryland, just outside of Washington D.C. Since graduating high school I have moved many times and lived on two continents. I&#39;ve been to 4 colleges in 4 states. 
<ol>
<li> Montgomery College, Germantown, MD</li>
<li>Chrichton University, Memphis TN</li>
<li> MMI, Phoenix, AZ </li>
<li> Eastern Washington University, Cheney, WA</li></p>

<p></ol></p>

<p>My journey to EWU is kind of crazy. I was a mechanic for many years. Once the economy crashed and every dealership I worked for went bankrupt I decided it was time to change careers. I originally came to Washington to study nursing because my uncle is a doctor and my aunt is a pharmacist. Naturally, I thought this would be the place to be to study the medical field. Two months after moving here I was hit by a drunk driver. The accident cause significant damage to my spine and the doctors told me that physically, I will never be able to be a nurse, because i won&#39;t be able to stand for 8-12 hours or lift patients. So I chose a new path. </p>

<p>Once my 3 months of bed rest were over, I enrolled at EWU. Originally I thought I would pursue a teaching career, but I realized that my background with mechanics and manuals would be better put to use in the technical communication field. I changed my major and never looked back. However, the further I get into the design classes I think that maybe I chose wrong. I really like the design aspect of the major and it is liberating to be able to create things freely: not following a set in stone structure. But it&#39;s too late now, as I&#39;m a few months away from graduating. Regardless, I have enjoyed my time at Eastern and look forward to what the future holds. </p>

<h2>Professional Objectives</h2>

<p>Ideally I would love to work for Tesla Motors in their marketing and design department.
I want my name to be know and synonymous with excellent work and work ethic. 
I would love to start at the bottom as a researcher and designer and work my way up to creative director, then possibly start my own company. </p>
